# EXAMPLE CHAT FORMAT

USER:
I want to build a project management tool for small teams.

AI:
That's a great idea! Let's explore this. What specific problems
are small teams facing that your tool would solve?

USER:
Teams use too many tools - Slack for communication, Trello for
tasks, Google Docs for documentation. Everything is scattered.

AI:
I see. So the core problem is fragmentation - information scattered
across multiple tools. What would your ideal solution look like?

USER:
One place where teams can:
- See all tasks
- Discuss tasks (comments)
- Track progress
- Know who's working on what

AI:
Got it. So we're talking about a unified workspace. Let me ask:
1. Is this for tech teams or any team?
2. How many people per team typically?
3. Any specific industry?

USER:
Mainly tech teams, 5-15 people, mostly remote.
