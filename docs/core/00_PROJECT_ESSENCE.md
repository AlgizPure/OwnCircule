## <¯ VISION

### One-Liner
> [One sentence: What is this project?]

**Example:**
> A collaborative task management platform that helps remote teams stay aligned and productive.

### The Big Picture

[2-3 paragraphs: Why does this project exist? What problem does it solve? What's the long-term vision?]

**Example:**

Remote teams struggle with coordination. Messages get lost in Slack,
tasks scatter across tools, and nobody has a clear view of who's doing what.

[Project Name] brings everything together in one place. Teams can see
all tasks, discuss in context, and track progress without switching tools.

Our vision is to become the central hub for remote team collaboration,
where work happens transparently and efficiently.

## <¨ PRODUCT PRINCIPLES

### Design Principles

1. **[Principle 1]**
   [What it means in practice]

**Example:**

1. **Simplicity Over Features**
   When in doubt, do less. Every feature must justify its complexity.
   Remove features before adding them.

2. **Async-First**
   Design for async work. Real-time is great, but never required.
   Team members in different timezones should have equal experience.

3. **Context is King**
   Never make users hunt for information. Show relevant context
   everywhere: who, what, when, why.

*(List 3-5 principles)*

### Technical Principles

1. **[Principle 1]**
   [What it means in practice]

**Example:**

1. **Performance is a Feature**
   <100ms interactions, <2s page loads. No compromises.

2. **Data Ownership**
   Users own their data. Easy export, no lock-in.

3. **Security by Default**
   Secure by design, not as afterthought. Regular audits.

*(List 3-5 principles)*

## =« NON-GOALS (Explicit Scope)

What we're **NOT** building (at least not now):

- L [Non-goal 1]
- L [Non-goal 2]
- L [Non-goal 3]

**Example:**

- L Time Tracking (use dedicated tools)
- L Invoicing/Billing (not a finance tool)
- L Email Client (integrate, don't replace)
- L Video Calls (Zoom/Meet are fine)
- L Enterprise Features in MVP (focus on teams <50)

**Why document this?**
Prevents scope creep. These might be future features, but not now.

## =¡ KEY INSIGHTS & CONTEXT

### Market Context

[What's the market landscape? Competitors? Timing?]

**Example:**

Market is crowded (Asana, Monday, Jira, etc.) but:
- Tools are bloated (too many features)
- Remote work surged (new needs)
- Younger teams want simpler tools
- Opportunity: Simple + Real-time + Smart

### Technical Context

[Any technical constraints, opportunities, or decisions?]

**Example:**

- Target: Web-first, mobile later
- Real-time: Critical (use WebSockets)
- Scale: Start small (1k users), design for 100k
- Data: Relational structure (PostgreSQL)

### User Research Insights

[Key learnings from user research, if any]

**Example:**

From 20 user interviews:
- "Current tools feel like homework" (12/20)
- "I want to see, not be told" (15/20)
- "Setup takes too long" (18/20)
- "Mobile experience is broken" (10/20)

Takeaway: Simplicity and mobile are critical.
